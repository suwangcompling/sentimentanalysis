GMO is just another tool to accomplish that goal . URL & v=rAL_AMdMXqY # ! Try Start PERSON instead of Google it will not record your IP or where you are surfing\",\n",
       "       u\"Hey Gang , A few days ago , I emailed out a piece concerning Dr . PERSON Sherman , Polio , and Cancer . This piece is primarily from a bunch of electronic engineers I tag along with via a group email . It was a departure from the normal subject matter and fits nicely as well as time appropriately with the Dr . PERSON article . There are three pieces I would like to present for you to consider . The first is a simple cure from PERSON Gray within the engineers group . The second is a submitted piece that adds to the discussion by revealing the money interests of the Rockefeller , and Carnegie Foundations , financial grants to the Medical Schools , with the condition they cooperate with them . Rockefeller and Carnegie also requested they insert some of their people into the Medical Schools , Board of Directors . This opened the door to the Pharmaceuticals and thus was born the drug industry via the American Medical Association , AMA . It is becoming obvious to me at least that the biggest lie concerning cancer is the genetic link . I am well aware that there is testing to determine if a person has the cancer gene , which supposedly predisposes an individual to cancer . What the heck does that mean ! ! ! From a government statistics point of view , you can take statistics and twist them into telling whatever narrative you want . So what is this cancer gene story , how is it determined , and how is it different from tortured statistics . The third piece is a short pdf file about Dr . PERSON Heinrich Warburg , that supports the first two . My hope is that you will find some value in this . If you do then please share it . If not , then feel free to beat the crap out of me for daring to speak out against the medical establishment . I am not a doctor or nor do I have any medical training . That does not mean I am medically ignorant . I do not regard doctors as living gods whose word can not be questioned . Just the opposite . My thoughts to the medical community are , Sit Down ! You sold out years ago when you bought into the French chemist , PERSON Pasteur 's Germ Theory as the cause of disease , and discarded Antoinne Bechamp 's discovery that micro organisms are part of the basic structure of cells . It is through this cell structure , and a fermentation process , that results in the formation of germs . Furthermore , Bechamp argues that , `` Germs cleanse the human system and free it from accumulations of pathogenic and mucoid matter . '' So without further adieu : Cancer Cure URL & feature=youtu.be Cancer Cure details featuring the `` One Disease '' , toxemia of the blood stream ; and one of its many symptoms , cancer . I could write for hours on this topic but the idea of this video is to show how to cure cancer in the briefest possible manner . As for the `` One disease '' , well there is only one degenerative disease and this is called `` Toxemia of The Bloodstream '' . This one disease has about NUMBER symptoms . The NUMBER medically catalogued diseases are only symptoms , which are easily removed by curing the one disease . Cancer , AIDS , Heart disease , Asthma , Diabetes , Lupus , Arthritis , Osteoporosis etc . , are only symptoms . Apart from genetic causes and prescription drugs , all cases of degenerative disease , sickness and disease , are self inflicted -- -yes -- -well how is that possible you might ask -- -what is it that I do that makes me sick you might ask -- -what is it that we all do that causes disease ? To put it very bluntly -- -it 's the food that we eat -- -yes , the food that we eat , that 's what makes us sick -- -that 's what causes us to suffer disease . Well , what 's wrong with the food then ? Well ! To begin with , it 's unnatural -- -it 's dead -- -it 's cooked , devitalized , denatured , and the worst part about it all , is , it is acid forming in the body . As long as we continue to eat these types of harmful acid forming foods , which change the chemistry of our bloodstream , from alkaline to acid , we will continue to suffer sickness and disease . Now for us to be in good health our blood must always be alkaline , with a Ph reading between NUMBER and NUMBER , and any deviation either above or below this range means disease . So , what is the reading ? Our blood must always be alkaline and the Ph reading must be between NUMBER and NUMBER -- -- if it 's above that -- -or below that -- -the body is ill at ease -- -it is diseased . Eating raw fruit and raw vegetables will keep us in perfect health with the correct Ph levels in our body and bloodstream . Cancer can not live in a healthy body Cancer : The Hidden Truth & Suppressed Cures - S.A.I.N URL This short educational film explores the hidden truths of the history , politics and science behind the cancer industry . For over NUMBER years , doctors , nurses , scientists , academics , researchers , film makers , authors and members of the general public alike have provided or exposed the cures for many forms of cancer , some were labeled `` quacks '' even in the face of strong evidence , whilst the `` mainstream '' medical establishment failed to find any non surgical or nontoxic therapy over the same period . Some of these pioneers went to prison ... . not for providing false cures ... . but for not having a license or some other `` trading '' violation . In almost every case , no proper and unbiased government study was ever completed on these therapies . This presentation is only a snapshot of the vast amount of information available on this subject , and provides you with a starting point for you to do further research of your own . You will find links to all the source material that helped make this presentation possible in the final credits . We have provided this information free of any charge , please make copies and pass around the people you care about if you find the information helpful . This film makes no medical claims and its purpose is purely informative . The authors do not promote any particular cure nor do they suggest that patients should eventually abandon their on going therapies in favor of any other . S.A.I.N -- Promoting Freedom and Free Thinking around the World Dr . PERSON Heinrich Warburg , NUMBER Nobel Prize Winner - The Root Cause of Cancer URL -prize winner the root cause of cancer Dr . PERSON Warburg discovered the root cause of cancer in NUMBER and he received the Nobel Prize for doing so in NUMBER . Dr. Warburg was director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute ( now Max Planck Institute ) for cell physiology at Berlin . He investigated the metabolism of tumors and the respiration of cells , particularly cancer cells . Below are some direct quotes by Dr. Warburg during medical lectures where he was the keynote speaker : '' Cancerous tissues are acidic , whereas healthy tissues are alkaline . Water splits into H+ and OH ions , if there is an excess of H+ , it is acidic ; if there is an excess of OH ions , then it is alkaline .

       "       u\"Hey PERSON , Apologize for missing your call the other day , I been extremely busy the past couple weeks . I been meaning to call you back . Cait and I are still in search mode to find a good deal in certain areas . I 'm thinking most of the houses we would consider are being taken off the market faster than we can search on the websites for . We really PERSON't need anything big right now , we are thinking 14000800SF starter home . Average lot size . We are split on the location . We are thinking West and Southwest Austin . We PERSON't know if we 'll be in Austin for another NUMBER years so we want to be able to sell it quickly if we move . Location is # NUMBER for us . We are willing to put work into a house , but we need it to be within 1005min driving distance to downtown Austin . I 'm not exactly sure how East Austin would be . See we are fairly new to this area and we 're not exactly sure , but we know we need a house that gives off a good perpective on the location . We 're paying $ NUMBER/month on rent for 700sf . We PERSON't really go downtown like we used to . We want to be able to get a return on our money later on . The list of needs are below . As of right now Cait is going over her options with a few different companies , she decided to go in a different direction . I 'm sure she 'll have something lined up by the new year if not sooner . NUMBER ) Location is key . Good neighborhood . We have a dog , so be nice to have a backyard with a deck.. something . NUMBER ) price range . We qualified well over what we want to spend . We have a wedding and other things we are saving for so we PERSON't want to go all in on a starter home . NUMBER . NUMBER ) All floors work but carpet , but again we are willing to work on the house . Fireplace would be great . This is not a rush . Our lease is up in March and this is stricktly for you to keep us in mind if something comes up or if you have any ideas on what we would like . We want the perspective on where the house is at to be great ... we are not picky on what 's all inside . I really appreciate all your help ! I will keep a close eye on my Gmail account and feel free to call me . Again it 's not a rush to move in next month but I figured I would let you know so you can keep a lookout for something we might jump on . If it 's right we will make a fast decision . Thanks !
